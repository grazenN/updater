# updater
A short script to update, refresh and clean up debian (plus flatpak and snaps if available).
The script runs various maintenance tasks including update, upgrade and a refresh of the system.
It also updates and refreshes any installed flatpaks or snap repositories. 
It completes, autodeletes older or unused files then runs neofetch to give you a summary of the system.
It then asks if you want to shut the system down or restart, logout or continue. A handy little utility.

Download it then make it executable by running chmod +x updater.sh. 
You can execute it by running ./updater.sh.
